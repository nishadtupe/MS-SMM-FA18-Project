# Abstract
Twitter is one of the most vastly used social media platforms that
allow individuals to voice their opinions on a broad range of topics,
one of them is sports. Fans frequently use Twitter to show their
admiration and support for their favorite teams and athletes, as well
as dislikes towards the opponents. Our project is utilizing those
types of tweets with the goal of analyzing sentiment around the
cricket series between the West Indies and India team played in
November 2018. In addition to the sentiment analysis, the project
includes the use of the machine learning methods with the goal of
classifying tweets based on team and individual player. The team
had also explored the properties of playerâ€™s interactions network
present in the tweets and briefly test the hypothesis based on the
network assortativity property. Our findings show that fan sentiment
and their support varies significantly for a team and as well
as for players. We also observed consistent performing players are
discussed more often together. We believe our study can aid in
the efforts to promote sports and may also help sports governing
authorities to choose their ambassadors.
